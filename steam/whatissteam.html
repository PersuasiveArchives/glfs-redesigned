        Steam is an application that can execute a variety of games and even
        software, which can even execute Windows applications without the
        need of Wine via the Steam tool Proton. This can can be a replacement
        for Wine although some applications might not work as expected. Most
        games are built for Windows but most work just fine via Proton and
        Proton works both on regular Linux distributions, including LFS
        without all the setup required for Wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Steam is a gaming application, it depends on many tools,
        libraries, and graphics APIs to function and perform as it should.
        Obvious among such software would be OpenGL, Vulkan, and graphics
        drivers. Less obvious software includes audio and a window manager or
        desktop environment.

        Please check <a class="xref" href="steamdeps.html" title=
        "Steam Dependencies">Steam Dependencies</a> to find what you will
        need before proceeding, although most of <a class="xref" href=
        "../shareddeps/sdchapter.html" title=
        "Part&nbsp;III.&nbsp;Shared Dependencies">Shared Dependencies</a> is
        a straight shot. There is some choice involved such as choosing if
        you want X11 or Wayland, Alsa or Pulseaudio, so forth.

    </h1>
    <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
      <p>
        On Linux, there are multiple drivers that one can install. Choosing
        the one you need can be difficult if you do not know what drivers are
        for what vendor and the perks and downsides of each option. This
        section explains all of that to better help you decide what you want
        or need.

      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <h2 class="sect2">
          AMD
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are 3 AMD GPU drivers: AMDGPU (Radeon Southern Islands and
          later), ATI (r300 and r600), and AMDGPU PRO (proprietary AMDGPU
          driver).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>AMDGPU</em></span>: This driver is for
          AMD GPUs that are Southern Island Cards or later. It is open source
          and is the most standard AMD GPU driver. This driver is in the
          Linux kernel and has two Mesa dri drivers: Gallium driver -
          <span class="emphasis"><em>radeonsi</em></span> and Vulkan driver -
          <span class="emphasis"><em>amd</em></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>ATI</em></span>: This driver is for the
          ATI AMD GPUs which precede GCN GPUs. It is open source and targets
          older GPUs. The driver is in the Linux kernel and has three Mesa
          dri drivers: Gallium drivers - <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>r300</em></span> and <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>r600</em></span>; and Vulkan driver - <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>amd</em></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>AMDGPU PRO</em></span>: This driver is
          proprietary. Most users don't install this driver as the open
          source drivers are already well off. However, it is needed for
          hardware acceleration encoding, useful for those who wish to record
          and edit videos. Performance in games varies between the open
          source and proprietary drivers so the ending factor is if you
          record and edit videos or not. You will need the firmware and open
          source kernel driver for this driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Summary: If you are a regular user with a modern AMD GPU, use
          <span class="emphasis"><em>AMDGPU</em></span>. If you have an older
          card, go with <span class="emphasis"><em>ATI</em></span>. Use
          <span class="emphasis"><em>AMDGPU PRO</em></span> if you want an
          improvement with hardware acceleration encoding.

          Intel
        </h2>
        <p>
          Intel provides open source drivers, but for sake of simplicity, all
          the relevant open source drivers will be classified as one -
          <span class="emphasis"><em>i915</em></span>. There is another
          driver called <span class="emphasis"><em>uvesafb</em></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>i915</em></span>: This driver, or rather
          collection of drivers, is for most Intel integrated and discrete
          GPUs. It is a single option in the Linux kernel but has various
          Mesa Gallium3D and Vulkan dri drivers. There is a good list on the
          MESA page under Command Explanations that will explain what
          Gallium3D and Vulkan driver you will need.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>uvesafb</em></span>: This driver is for
          the Intel GMA 3600 series, a family of integrated video adapters
          based on the PowerVR SGX 545 graphics core. This driver was in the
          kernel since 3.5 but no longer since 4.15. This driver is not
          included in the book because of its lack of use by most people, but
          has a good Arch Linux wiki page at <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Intel_GMA_3600">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Intel_GMA_3600</a>.

          NVIDIA
        </h2>
        <p>
          The situation revolving around NVIDIA is more unfortunate than the
          two vendors listed above and more complicated. NVIDIA does not
          support open source drivers besides their own open source kernel
          modules. Therefore performance with the open source drivers,
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span> and <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>NVK</em></span>, are slightly worse than NVIDIA's
          proprietary driver. Installing the proprietary driver can be
          easier. There is another driver called <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>Zink</em></span> which translates Vulkan calls to
          OpenGL calls which can replace <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span>: This driver is open
          source and has worse performance than <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>NVIDIA</em></span>. It is technically a kernel
          driver, a Mesa Gallium3D driver, and Mesa Vulkan driver, although
          they have different parts and the Vulkan driver is often referred
          to as <span class="emphasis"><em>NVK</em></span>, depsite being
          referred to as nouveau in <a class="xref" href="mesa.html" title=
          "Mesa-25.0.2">Mesa-25.0.2</a>'s <em class="parameter"><code>-D
          vulkan-drivers</code></em> parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>NVK</em></span>: This driver is a new
          Mesa Vulkan driver and in its production, involved several kernel
          patches. It is a Vulkan driver targetting Turing and later NVIDIA
          GPUs. It does provide better performance than <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span> and is still improving. If you
          want to compile this driver, you are going to need <a class="xref"
          href="rustc.html" title="Rustc-1.85.1">rustc-1.85.1</a>, and if you
          are doing multilib, are going to need the i686-unknown-linux-gnu
          target. Also make sure to install <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span> if you want to install this
          driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Zink</em></span>: This driver is a
          Gallium3D driver in <a class="xref" href="mesa.html" title=
          "Mesa-25.0.2">Mesa-25.0.2</a>, converting OpenGL calls to Vulkan
          calls, drastically improving performance. It isn't specifically
          related to <span class="emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span> but as
          performance with <span class="emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span> is
          not the best, using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Zink</em></span>
          driver with <span class="emphasis"><em>NVK</em></span> is a great
          idea. You can find out how to use <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>Zink</em></span> instead in <a class="xref" href=
          "whatnow.html" title="What Now?">What Now?</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>NVIDIA</em></span>: This is the
          proprietary driver and the performance of this driver is better
          than the open source alternatives. It allows the use of NVIDIA's
          CUDA project which is useful for hardware acceleration, improving
          performance of games and workstation applications. This driver has
          a lot of issues to this day but still provides better performance,
          thus its installation is provided in this book. Firmware isn't
          needed as it is provided by this driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Summary: If you want good performance and care about workstation
          use cases, install <span class="emphasis"><em>NVIDIA</em></span>.
          If you only use OpenGL applications and don't want the proprietary
          NVIDIA driver, use <span class="emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span>.
          If you use a variety of applications and play games that utilize
          Direct3D and Vulkan, install both <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span> and <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>NVK</em></span>. Installing <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>Zink</em></span> is a good idea, too.

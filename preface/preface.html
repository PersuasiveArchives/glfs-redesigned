      <p>
        After around 2 or 3 months of my first ever install of Linux From
        Scratch, I had an question: how do I install <span class=
        "application">Steam</span> on this? After some time, I went for
        Beyond Linux From Scratch, a very great book that covered most of
        what I both wanted and needed, but my <span class=
        "application">Steam</span> question never got answered. So I just
        tried to install the <span class="application">Steam</span> tarball
        and I went down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond Linux From Scratch didn't show how so I felt alone and on my
        own. I learned shortly after my attempt that I need multilib, and
        Bruce Dubbs saw my email and responded quite promptly saying to go to
        Thomas' Multilib mirror. This made all the difference, but now I
        needed to find out all the packages to install, all the
        configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rahul Chandra in the same thread mentioned his scripts for his
        distro, Tucana. These scripts helped so much, even if all the scripts
        were presented all at once. Once I had got <span class=
        "application">Steam</span> to work, I realized that in some way,
        somehow, I must share how I did it and to help others with a single
        comprehensive guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, I also decided to try to get Wine to work. I was
        successful. I, again like with <span class="application">Steam</span>
        before, wanted to share the process. Rahul reached out to me, and
        that led to this book's creation and editing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you, and I hope this helps you.
